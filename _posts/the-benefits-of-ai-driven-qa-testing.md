## What Is AI-Driven QA Testing?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in QA testing signifies the use of machine learning models, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive algorithms to replace or enhance traditional testing processes. AI simplifies key QA tasks, from anomaly detection to predictive defect analysis, ensuring reliable results and improved performance.

Previously, QA relied heavily on manual testing methods, followed by automation testing tools requiring human oversight. AI transforms this approach with self-learning systems that adapt to data insights and dynamically improve testing effectiveness. Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai?src=evenbuild.vercel.app) leverage innovative features to streamline complex workflows, empowering teams with smarter testing protocols.
