## Current QA Challenges and Issues

### 1. Growing Product Complexity
Interconnected software, cloud computing, and edge technologies require QA teams to manage intricate systems and integration processes effectively.

### 2. Faster Development Cycles
Agile and DevOps methodologies leave little room for extensive QA testing, increasing the risk of undetected bugs.

### 3. Balancing Automation and Manual Testing
While automation boosts efficiency, manual testing remains vital for identifying context-sensitive issues—challenging QA teams to strike the right balance.

### 4. Scalable Solutions
Global business expansion demands scalable QA methods to ensure consistent deliverables regardless of location or system complexity.
