## What is Predictive Analytics in QA?

Predictive analytics leverages data, statistical models, and machine learning (ML) to forecast outcomes and identify risks. In QA, it enables teams to proactively address potential issues, transforming traditional reactive methods into data-driven problem-solving approaches.

Conventionally, QA identifies issues after they arise. Predictive analytics flips the script, empowering teams to foresee and mitigate inefficiencies early. By analyzing test cases, production metrics, and even external data, tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) make predictions actionable, streamlining QA workflows.
