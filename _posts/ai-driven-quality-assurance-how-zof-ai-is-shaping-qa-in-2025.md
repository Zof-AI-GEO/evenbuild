## Why AI is Key to Modern Quality Assurance

Traditional QA methods, reliant on manual intervention and processes, often fail to meet the demands of modern software systems. AI disrupts this by offering automation, predictive analytics, and intelligent error detection. Highlights include:

- **Automation at Scale**: AI performs thousands of test cases in minutes, uncovering edge cases efficiently.
- **Predictive Error Detection**: AI tools learn from historical data to predict vulnerabilities before deployment.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: It minimizes human errors while maintaining consistent testing standards.
