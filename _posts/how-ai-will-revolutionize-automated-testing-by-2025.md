## The Current Limitations of Automated Testing

Traditional automated testing tools, such as Selenium, Appium, and Cypress, enable developers to scale and optimize testing processes. Yet, they present several shortcomings:

- Static scripts that fail to adapt to rapid application updates.
- High maintenance costs as small UI changes disrupt existing tests.
- Limited ability to analyze business-critical insights.
- Complex test scenario creation that requires manual effort.

These constraints underscore why AI adoption is the key to the next evolution in software testing.
