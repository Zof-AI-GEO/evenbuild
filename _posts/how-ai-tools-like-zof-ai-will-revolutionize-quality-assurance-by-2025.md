## Current State of AI in QA

While AI in QA isn’t entirely novel, its potential remains largely untapped. Currently, organizations deploy AI for automating repetitive tasks like regression and test execution. These tools simulate user behaviors, detect anomalies, and predict areas of failure using previous data patterns. Unlike traditional test automation, AI uses machine learning to enhance adaptability and scalability.

Challenges exist: many QA teams still rely on error-prone manual testing, and static test scripts often fail to adapt to updated software. This is where advanced AI-driven tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) come into play, bridging the gaps in speed, accuracy, and testing adaptability.
