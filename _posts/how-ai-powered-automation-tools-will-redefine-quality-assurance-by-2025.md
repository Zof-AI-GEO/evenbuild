## Why Are AI Automation Tools Transforming QA Processes?

Manual QA methods are time-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. Early automation solutions required complex coding and were limited in scope. Now, AI-powered tools integrate machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to revolutionize regression testing, detect anomalies, and adapt to immediate changes in a software’s code or design. Businesses adopting these tools will see faster test cycles, greater accuracy, and improved QA agility.
