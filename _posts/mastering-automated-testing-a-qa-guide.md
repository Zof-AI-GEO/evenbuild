## Introduction to Automated QA Testing

Automated QA testing uses specialized tools to execute predefined test cases, streamlining the testing process and increasing reliability while reducing manual intervention. It’s ideal for handling repetitive tasks such as regression, functionality, and performance testing, significantly improving efficiency in the software development lifecycle.

While automated testing has numerous benefits, it complements, rather than replaces, manual methods like exploratory or usability testing, which rely on human judgment. Together, these methods provide a well-rounded approach to QA.
