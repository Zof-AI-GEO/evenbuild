## The Evolution of Quality Assurance

The history of QA reflects software development itself. Decades ago, QA relied heavily on manual workflows, where testers painstakingly validated code line by line. When software systems became more complex, automation tools like Selenium and JUnit revolutionized the field, enabling quicker and more efficient testing solutions.

Despite these advances, traditional automation faces challenges. Writing exhaustive test scenarios is time-intensive, often leaving room for defects. Modern software iterations outpace scripting capabilities, underscoring the need for smarter solutions. Enter artificial intelligence: By 2025, AI-driven QA is not optional but essential.
