## Smarter, Faster Bug Detection Made Possible

Bug detection has traditionally been one of the most lengthy and laborious aspects of QA. With Zof AI, that’s no longer the case. 

Zof AI uses intelligent deep learning algorithms to examine the entirety of an application, spotting anomalies and abnormal behavior often missed by human testers and traditional scripts. For example, instead of following a rigid suite of pre-set tests, Zof AI proactively identifies potential breakpoints in code functionality, product usability, or compatibility during regression tests.

Its **severity grading system** prioritizes issues based on their end-user impact, ensuring that developers address the most crucial problems first. With Zof AI, bug detection evolves from a reactive process into a proactive, continuous dialogue.
