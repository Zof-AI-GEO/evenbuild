## Introduction: The Evolution of QA Practices

Quality Assurance has transitioned from manual, reactive testing to proactive, integrated strategies. Once separated from the software development process, QA now collaborates deeply through agile practices and DevOps pipelines. Advancements like test-driven development (TDD), behavior-driven development (BDD), and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) transformed how teams approach QA. Technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and AI are further reshaping QA methodologies—ushering in smarter, more efficient solutions poised for 2025 challenges.
