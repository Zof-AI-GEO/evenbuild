## Addressing Persistent QA Challenges in Modern Software Development

Even with advancements over time, traditional QA methodologies still face key hurdles:

### 1. Manual Testing: A Bottleneck
Modern applications' increasing complexity makes manual testing infeasible due to the growing volume of test cases. Manual processes limit speed and thorough coverage.

### 2. Reactive Bug Detection
Traditional QA methods often detect bugs late, leading to costly fixes, delays, and reduced customer trust. 

### 3. Scalable Testing Limitations
Software sophistication demands ample scalability, which most tools fail to provide effectively, resulting in missed edge cases and errors.

### 4. Collaboration Challenges
Communication gaps between QA and development teams create inefficiencies, slowing down debugging and resolution.
