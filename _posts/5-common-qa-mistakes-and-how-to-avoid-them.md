## 1. Overview: Common Errors in Software QA

Recognizing frequent QA errors is key to building efficient testing workflows. Some major QA pitfalls include:

- **Neglecting Test Planning:** Without clear test plans, crucial bugs may escape detection.
- **Over-reliance on Manual Testing:** Manual testing can be error-prone and labor-intensive for repetitive tasks.
- **Team Miscommunication:** Poor collaboration between QA and development teams causes delays and misalignments.
- **Skipping Regression Testing:** Adding new features without retesting old functionality can introduce problems.
- **Ignoring Automation Tools:** Outdated or inefficient methods slow workflows and reduce accuracy.

These issues are preventable with effective strategies, modern tools, and streamlined practices.

## 2. Why Manual QA Errors Are Common

Manual QA doesn’t rely on machines—creativity and human intuition often identify nuanced issues. However, manual QA has inherent limitations:

- **Fatigue from Repetitive Testing:** Testers may overlook bugs due to weariness.
- **Inconsistent Processes:** Different approaches by team members result in inconsistency.
- **Time-Intensive:** Manually performing repetitive tests slows development timelines.

A wise approach combines manual testing strengths with the efficiency of automation tools.
