## Predictive Analytics and Proactive QA

Predictive analytics uses statistical modeling, machine learning (ML), and data mining to forecast future outcomes. In QA, it analyzes historical data, defect patterns, user behavior, and system performance, enabling teams to preemptively address issues. This proactive QA approach minimizes manual testing inefficiencies and enhances reliability.

Using predictive testing, organizations can shift their focus to critical areas prone to failure, reducing testing cycles, lowering costs, and meeting quality standards faster.
