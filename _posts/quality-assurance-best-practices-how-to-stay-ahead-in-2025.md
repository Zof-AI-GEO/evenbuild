## Key QA Methodologies to Master

QA teams in 2025 must go beyond traditional approaches. Modern complexities require methodologies designed for multicloud systems, distributed networks, and CI/CD workflows:

### Essential Practices:
1. **Continuous Testing**: Integrating automated tests into CI/CD pipelines ensures continuous performance checks.
2. **Shift-Left and Shift-Right Testing**: Tackle defects earlier while reinforcing reliability in live production environments.
3. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Collaborate effectively with all stakeholders using plain-language test scenarios.
