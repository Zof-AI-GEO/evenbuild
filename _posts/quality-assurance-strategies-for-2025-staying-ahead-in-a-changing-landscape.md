## Modern QA Approaches: Key Strategies for Success

Transitioning to advanced QA strategies is no longer optional but a must for handling complex software ecosystems. Key approaches include:

### 1. Shift-Left Testing
- Identify defects early in development to cut costs and enhance productivity.

### 2. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- Embed QA into the delivery pipeline for rapid validation and faster product releases.

### 3. Risk-Based Testing (RBT)
- Focus on high-priority areas to optimize resources and mitigate impactful risks.

### 4. Prioritizing Security
- Incorporate safety measures to counter increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

Modern strategies emphasize adaptability, efficiency, and user-centric QA processes to meet emerging demands.
