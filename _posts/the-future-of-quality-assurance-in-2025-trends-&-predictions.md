## The Evolution of QA to Match Agile Software Development

QA has evolved from manual testing processes to fully automated CI/CD pipelines integrated within software development lifecycles. The "shift-left" approach, enabling early bug detection, along with real-time feedback mechanisms, has established QA as a dynamic and integral component of DevOps workflows.

Continuous testing has empowered QA teams to reduce inefficiencies and deliver quality products at record speed. With AI-driven advancements, smarter tools are emerging to pave the way for more precise testing strategies and impact analysis.
