## Understanding How AI Enhances QA

AI enables software systems to mimic human decision-making with advanced capabilities like machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. In QA, AI significantly improves test processes by automating repetitive workflows, reducing human error, and delivering actionable behavioral insights. Key advancements include:

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Analyzes previous test scripts and generates optimized testing strategies.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Maps written requirements and feedback into automated test cases.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts potential software bugs, streamlining QA efforts.

These AI capabilities drive higher test coverage, faster iterations, and top-tier software quality without additional cost or time investment.
