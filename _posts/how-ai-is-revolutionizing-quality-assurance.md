## Overview of AI’s Role in QA

AI introduces powerful capabilities into QA, revolutionizing manual processes. Traditional QA involved creating test cases, executing them, and catching errors, but AI leverages machine learning, predictive analytics, natural language processing (NLP), and automated scripts to streamline and enhance these workflows. AI’s common applications include error detection, test case generation, test execution, defect reporting, and seamless integration in CI/CD pipelines. 

From predictive analytics to defect reporting, AI is redefining software testing methodologies, making it indispensable for modern development teams.
