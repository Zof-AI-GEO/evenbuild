## AI and Machine Learning Transforming QA Processes

Traditional QA methods, reliant on manual or semi-automated frameworks, can no longer meet the demands of complex and large-scale software systems. This is where AI and ML step in to revolutionize QA. 

AI can simulate human interaction with software beyond conventional test scripts, while ML identifies patterns indicative of flawed code or bottlenecks. Key benefits include:

- **Automation of Repetitive Testing**: Saves time and enhances accuracy.
- **Early Detection of Bugs**: Identifies potential issues that manual methods may miss.
- **Support for Agile/DevOps**: Enables continuous testing and feedback, integral for seamless workflows.
