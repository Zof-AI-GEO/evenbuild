## Introduction to QA Automation

QA automation leverages tools and frameworks to automate testing and streamline workflows. Unlike manual testing, which entails repetitive human intervention, automated systems deploy pre-written test scripts to efficiently identify software flaws and validate functionality.

Automation enhances, rather than replaces, human expertise. It enables QA teams to focus on intricate challenges, exploratory testing, and creative problem-solving while delegating repetitive tasks to machines. The ethos is clear: let automation tackle repetitive precision, empowering humans to exercise creativity and critical thinking.
