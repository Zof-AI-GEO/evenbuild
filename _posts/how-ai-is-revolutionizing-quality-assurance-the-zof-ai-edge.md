## Introduction to AI in QA

Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing countless industries, and software testing is no exception. Historically, QA relied mainly on manual processes and basic automations, leading to inefficiencies and scaling issues in agile and DevOps-oriented environments. Today, AI has shifted these paradigms, utilizing machine learning algorithms and intelligent models to enable smarter decision-making, predictive analysis, and adaptive testing strategies.

AI’s ability to process large amounts of data makes it perfect for handling advanced QA tasks like test creation, bug detection, execution, maintenance, and analysis. As product delivery cycles grow tighter, adopting AI solutions for QA teams is no longer optional—it’s essential.
