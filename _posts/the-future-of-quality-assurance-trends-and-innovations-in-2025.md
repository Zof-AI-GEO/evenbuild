Continuous Testing: A New Standard for Speed and Quality

Continuous Testing (CT) has become essential for agile software delivery in 2025. Integrated within CI/CD pipelines, CT ensures bugs are identified in real time, enhancing collaboration and minimizing risks associated with last-minute errors. Tools such as Selenium, TestComplete, and **[Zof AI](https://zof.ai)** streamline this automated testing process, accelerating delivery cycles without sacrificing quality.
