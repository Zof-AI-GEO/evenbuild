## What is Continuous Testing in 2025?

Continuous testing evaluates software quality during the development lifecycle, identifying issues early to align with Agile’s fast-paced iterative workflows. By 2025, continuous testing will adapt to:

1. **Shorter Deployment Cycles:** As companies aim for daily or hourly releases, testing must keep pace without delays.
2. **Expanding Tech Ecosystems:** Integration testing across IoT, edge computing, cloud systems, and AI becomes essential.
3. **AI-Powered Automation:** Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) will reduce manual testing efforts via intelligent automation.
4. **Predictive Testing:** Analytics will anticipate potential issues before code execution.
