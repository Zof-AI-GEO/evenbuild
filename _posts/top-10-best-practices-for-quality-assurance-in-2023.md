## Best Practices for QA in Agile Development

### 1. Shift Left Testing
Implement testing during early development phases.

### 2. Agile QA Integration
Fast feedback and iterative testing methods support Agile workflows.

### 3. Real-World Testing Scenarios
Test apps across devices and environments for compatibility and performance.

### 4. Cross-Functional Collaboration
Involve developers, QA teams, and stakeholders to align software quality with business goals.

### 5. Regression Testing
Prevent new updates from breaking previously stable functions.

### 6. Prioritize Security QA
Incorporate robust security testing to detect vulnerabilities.

### 7. Utilize Accurate Test Data
Create datasets that represent real-world conditions effectively.
