## Common QA Workflow Challenges

To improve your QA process, it’s important to first address prevalent bottlenecks that many teams face.

### 1. Manual Testing Processes
Manual QA processes often result in slower productivity and are more prone to human errors. Without automation, these legacy workflows hinder team efficiency.

### 2. Repeating Tasks
The repetitive nature of running identical tests, recalibrating parameters, and revisiting documentation lowers team motivation and leads to wasted hours.

### 3. Long Feedback Loops
Lengthy delays between QA testing results and feedback loops can limit the overall speed of product improvements and value delivery.

### 4. Scaling Issues
Static, manual QA processes struggle to scale effectively as operations grow, resulting in resource strain and reduced results efficiency.

### 5. Disjointed Tools
Inconsistent integration between various platforms and tools can render QA processes disorganized and create inefficiencies, slowing team collaboration.

Addressing these widespread inefficiencies makes room for smoother operations, which is where Zof AI truly shines.
