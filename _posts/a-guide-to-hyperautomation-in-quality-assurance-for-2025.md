## What is Hyperautomation in Quality Assurance, and Why Is It Crucial?

Hyperautomation involves leveraging advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and Intelligent Business Process Management Systems (iBPMS) to automate end-to-end processes efficiently. In QA, hyperautomation elevates traditional test automation by fostering a unified workflow that integrates multiple tools and technologies intelligently.

Manual testing is no longer sustainable in the face of modern complexity. Traditional test automation, while useful, struggles to keep pace with development cycles. Hyperautomation resolves bottlenecks by creating synchronized workflows, enhancing agility, and enabling data-driven decisions. By 2025, its capabilities will spearhead reduced costs, faster delivery, and high-quality results.
