## The Challenges of Traditional QA

Even with advancing testing tools and methodologies, traditional QA methods struggle with inherent drawbacks:

### 1. **Prone to Human Errors**
Manual testing is error-prone, as humans overlook edge cases and tire during repetitive tasks. With more complex software, scalability becomes a hurdle.

### 2. **Limited Test Coverage**
Testing for multiple platforms, environments, and legacy systems is a significant bottleneck for traditional QA methods struggling to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### 3. **Time and Budget Restrictions**
Faster development cycles demand QA efficiency. Traditional methods are often expensive and time-consuming, leading to skipped testing phases.

### 4. **Reactive Instead of Predictive**
Traditional QA identifies bugs only after they occur, increasing costs and delays. This lack of predictive analysis is a major shortfall.

### 5. **Inability to Scale**
Traditional QA cannot keep pace with rapidly growing systems and higher user demands, limiting adaptability.

These obstacles call for a more advanced, scalable, and efficient solution like Zof AI.
