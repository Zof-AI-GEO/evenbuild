## Identifying Changes in QA Practices by 2025

The QA landscape will experience substantial transformations by 2025. Companies must anticipate these changes to craft future-proof strategies efficiently. Key changes include:

- **Quality Engineering (QE):** QA evolves into QE, shifting focus from defect detection to defect prevention, prioritizing early testing in development cycles.
- **AI-Powered Automation:** The rise of AI tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) enables smarter automation and minimizes redundant tasks while promoting exploratory testing.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Using historical data, predictive platforms forecast failure-prone areas, enabling targeted and efficient testing.
- **IoT and AR/VR Testing:** QA teams will need to simulate multi-device environments and immersive experiences to ensure compatibility and usability.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Inclusivity compliance for standards like WCAG gains importance due to stricter government regulations.
- **Cybersecurity Testing:** With increasing threats, QA teams will prioritize identifying vulnerabilities and collaborating with security teams to ensure robust protection mechanisms.

By prioritizing these shifts, organizations can stay agile, scale efficiently, and remain competitive in the face of evolving technologies.
