## Introduction: Redefining Agile QA for Continuous Delivery Pipelines

The pace of software delivery in 2025 is unprecedented, with pipelines managing thousands of updates and builds daily. Traditional QA methods centered on manual or phase-driven testing are now insufficient, giving rise to continuous QA practices. Modern agile principles demand integrated, automation-driven QA strategies that align with the delivery pipeline’s momentum while ensuring quality is an ingrained value.

The need for tools like **Zof AI** ([https://zof.ai](https://zof.ai)) has become prominent, revolutionizing testing with AI-powered automation to meet rapid-release speeds. This ensures agility and consistency, critical in today’s delivery standards, as the emphasis on 'shift-left' testing integrates QA into earlier development phases.
