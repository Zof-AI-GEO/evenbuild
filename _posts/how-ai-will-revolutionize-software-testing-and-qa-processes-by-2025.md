## AI's Impact on QA Processes

QA has traditionally been manual and resource-intensive, requiring developers and testers to identify issues, conduct usability tests, and meet compliance standards. While traditional automated tools brought efficiency, they lacked adaptability and left room for human errors.

AI, however, overcomes these limitations with capabilities like autonomous pattern recognition, real-time data analysis, and adaptive learning. Using technologies like machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics, AI-powered QA systems detect issues proactively, improve workflows, and reduce error margins.
