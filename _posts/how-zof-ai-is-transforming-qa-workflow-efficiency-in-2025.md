## The QA Workflow Problem: Challenges in Modern Software Development

Modern software systems continually increase in complexity, making QA processes more demanding. Below are the primary challenges QA teams face today:

- **System Complexity**: Handling large-scale architectures with microservices and dynamic interactions often overwhelms teams.
- **Strict Deadlines**: Faster product rollouts create time pressures, risking quality.
- **Skill Deficits**: Limited expertise in automation and testing frameworks restrict QA capabilities.
- **Scalability Hurdles**: Testing for high-scale, real-world conditions remains difficult without an adaptive, AI-driven solution.

Traditional QA methods struggle to optimize workflows under such conditions, necessitating advanced AI-powered systems like Zof AI for better precision and efficiency.
