## What is Automated Testing?

Automated testing utilizes software tools to perform pre-defined test cases on a software application without human intervention. These tools simulate user interactions, input data, and assess application functionality, reliability, and performance, delivering results far more swiftly than traditional manual testing methods.

By scheduling automated tests to run regularly—even during non-working hours—teams can identify and address issues earlier in the development cycle, ensuring smoother application deployments.
