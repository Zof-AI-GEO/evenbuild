## AI’s Game-Changing Role in QA Practices

AI has become the cornerstone of quality assurance (QA), evolving past manual, time-intensive testing methods. Advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms analyze vast datasets, predict potential bugs, and automate tedious QA tasks. Neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) enable simulation of user behavior, enhancing both functional accuracy and user experience.
