Hybrid QA Methodologies: Combining Human Expertise with Automation

Though automation is revolutionizing QA, **manual testing will always hold value**, especially in exploratory, usability, and emotional assessment scenarios. Hybrid methodologies offer the benefits of automation and human oversight collaboratively.

### Key Areas Where Automation and Manual Testing Intersect:
- **Exploratory Testing Augmented by AI**: AI guides testers toward high-risk areas.
- **Regression Testing**: Fully automated, while corner-case scenarios remain manually assessed.
- **Human-verified Load Testing**: Automation simulates high loads, but manual analysis interprets odd behaviors.

Hybrid approaches will dominate QA strategies by 2025, blending efficiency with creativity.
