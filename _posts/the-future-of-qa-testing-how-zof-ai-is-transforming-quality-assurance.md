## Why QA Needs AI: Challenges of Modern Software Testing

Modern software practices bring agility but also introduce challenges like scaled deployments, integration complexities, and avoiding human errors. Here’s why traditional QA struggles:

1. **Faster Development Timelines:** Agile methods and CI/CD demand rapid releases.
2. **Multi-dimensional Dependencies:** Complicated systems require heightened testing.
3. **Limited Manual Scalability:** Volume and repetition lead human testers to errors.
