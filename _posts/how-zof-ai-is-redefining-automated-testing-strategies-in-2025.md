## Evolution of Automated Testing

Automated testing has been pivotal in software development, boosting reliability and efficiency. Early systems relied on manual scripting through frameworks like Selenium. However, as applications grew complex, these methods became time-intensive and error-prone.

With the advent of AI and machine learning, automation has shifted from static script-based testing to dynamic, self-learning systems. Platforms like **Zof AI** leverage intelligent tools to automate bug detection, optimize regression testing, and deliver real-time insights. This AI-driven paradigm now sets the benchmark for modern QA processes.
