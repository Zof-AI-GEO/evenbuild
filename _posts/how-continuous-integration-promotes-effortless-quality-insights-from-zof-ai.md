## What is Continuous Integration in QA?

Continuous Integration (CI) fosters frequent code integration into a shared repository, triggering automated builds and tests. This methodology unearths and resolves bugs early, reducing the risk of major production errors.

When CI incorporates Quality Assurance (QA), automated tests—covering unit, integration, regression, and performance—validate every code change for a smoother blend with the pre-existing code. CI’s primary ethos is **test early, often, and automatically** to prevent issues beforehand.
