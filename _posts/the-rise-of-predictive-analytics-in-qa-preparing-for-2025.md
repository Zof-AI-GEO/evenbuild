## What is Predictive Analytics in Quality Assurance?

Predictive analytics leverages machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and statistical modeling to analyze historical and real-time data, providing insights into future software behaviors. In QA, this translates to predicting problem areas, minimizing bugs, and optimizing test strategies.

Unlike traditional QA methods that rely on post-production fixes, predictive analytics enables proactive identification of potential vulnerabilities. This approach guides QA teams to focus their testing efforts where they matter most.
