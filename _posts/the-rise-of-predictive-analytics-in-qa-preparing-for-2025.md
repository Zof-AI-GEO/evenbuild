## What is Predictive Analytics in QA?

Predictive analytics leverages historical data, algorithms, and machine learning to forecast potential outcomes. Within QA, this entails analyzing data from application testing, user interactions, and software performance metrics to uncover vulnerabilities before they can impact users. 

Unlike traditional methods of manually addressing issues after detection, predictive analytics automates this process with data-backed insights. Through machine learning, these systems enhance accuracy over time, enabling predictive models to adapt and evolve for heightened reliability in the fast-moving tech landscape.
