## How Automation Revolutionized QA Processes
Automation's journey in QA began with reducing repetitive tasks through frameworks like Selenium. It has created key innovations such as faster testing cycles, scalability across platforms, and precision-driven results. Over time, the shift to continuous testing (as seen in DevOps CI/CD pipelines) cemented automation's necessity in delivering seamless software updates.

However, traditional automation had limits in handling dynamic content. Today, AI-based platforms address these challenges by offering intelligent test generation, predictive analytics, and adaptability, changing the role of automation in QA.
