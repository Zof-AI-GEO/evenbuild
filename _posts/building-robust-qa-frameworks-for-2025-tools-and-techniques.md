## What Defines a Robust QA Framework?

A robust QA framework ensures scalability, resilience, visibility, and adaptability. It supports:

1. **Resilience**: Quickly recovering from failures during testing or production.
2. **Scalability**: Effortlessly adapting to complex and extensive projects.
3. **Visibility**: Providing actionable insights into test results and system behavior.
4. **Adaptability**: Responding to changing technologies and user demands.

Organizations must adopt tools and methodologies that promote these characteristics to build robust QA frameworks ready for 2025 and beyond.
