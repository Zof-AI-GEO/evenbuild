## AI Use Cases in Quality Assurance

Artificial Intelligence enables companies to process large-scale data sets, make intelligent predictions, and perform tasks that surpass human capabilities. Here’s a look at the primary applications of AI in QA practices:

1. **Automated Test Execution**: AI tools streamline manual, repetitive testing tasks, saving time and ensuring higher accuracy in results.
   
2. **Predictive Defect Analysis**: AI tools forecast defects and identify high-risk areas in code by analyzing historical test data and trends.

3. **Dynamic Test Creation**: Machine learning algorithms dynamically generate new test cases, improving coverage with minimal manual intervention.

4. **Requirements Processing with NLP**: Using Natural Language Processing, AI transforms written testing requirements into executable test cases, simplifying collaboration between developers and QA teams.

By leveraging these applications, QA teams can meet the increasing demands of modern, complex software systems more efficiently.
