## The Challenges of Scaling QA Processes: Why Traditional Methods Fall Behind

### **1. Exponential Test Case Growth**
With expanding software complexity, test cases and functionalities multiply—making extensive, manual testing unsustainable.

### **2. Time-to-Market Pressures**
Fast-paced methodologies like Agile and DevOps demand quicker delivery, leaving less time for thorough QA testing.

### **3. Escalating QA Costs**
Manual testing teams and infrastructures incur significant expenses, which only grow with system complexity.

### **4. Human Errors in Manual Testing**
Fatigue, repetitive tasks, and human limitations can lead to bugs slipping through to production.

### **5. Adapting to Dynamic Needs**
Changing customer demands and evolving features can overwhelm traditional testing frameworks.
