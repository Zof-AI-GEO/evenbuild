## Introduction to AI in QA Testing

AI has revolutionized industries through automation and workflow optimization, and QA testing is no exception. By utilizing machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics, AI identifies issues, automates repetitive tasks, and significantly boosts efficiency.

Traditional QA relies heavily on manual intervention and scripting, which can bottleneck larger projects. AI resolves these challenges by mimicking human decision-making and delivering data-backed insights. For development teams, adopting AI isn’t a question of "if," but "how." Let’s dive deeper.
