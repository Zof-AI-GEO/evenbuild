## What is Autonomous QA?

Traditional QA methods rely on manual scripts and interventions, which are often time-consuming and error-prone. Autonomous quality assurance replaces these static processes with intelligent AI and ML algorithms that can:

- Dynamically analyze application state,
- Write and optimize test cases,
- Create test environments,
- Execute tests independently, and
- Report root causes in real-time.

These systems adaptively implement context-based testing strategies and reduce false positives, driving faster release cycles while maintaining product quality.
