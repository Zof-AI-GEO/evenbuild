## The Past and Present of Quality Assurance

### Origins and Early Evolution
The journey of QA dates back to ancient artisans ensuring craftsmanship. However, the Industrial Revolution introduced systematic quality control as factories scaled production. Human inspectors managed defect detection, setting the foundation for modern QA.

### 20th Century Innovations
With the emergence of Total Quality Management (TQM) and Six Sigma during the 20th century, QA methods shifted to prevention and data-driven optimization. Today’s frameworks like Agile and DevOps integrate QA into continuous production cycles, reducing errors before they occur.

### The Challenges of Traditional QA
While forward-thinking, manual effort and human error limit traditional methods. As digital transformation accelerates, scaling QA processes becomes a challenge—making AI the critical solution, filling gaps that classic approaches leave behind.
