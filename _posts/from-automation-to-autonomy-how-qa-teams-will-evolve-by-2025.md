## Automation vs. Autonomy in QA

### What is Automation in QA?
Automation has boosted productivity by replacing repetitive manual testing with script-driven tools and frameworks. Yet, traditional automation relies heavily on predefined rules, lacking flexibility and requiring continuous human oversight for updates and maintenance.

### What’s Next? Introducing Autonomy in QA
Autonomous QA surpasses automation by introducing AI-based intelligence for decision-making and adaptability. Autonomous testing systems:

- Learn dynamically from user interactions and historical test data.
- Detect patterns, predict issues, and adjust without additional programming.
- Automate test updates, eliminating manual intervention.
- Anticipate and address software weak points before issues arise.

Platforms such as Zof AI are leading this revolutionary movement, offering tools that eliminate the need for constant scripting while boosting accuracy and efficiency.
