## How AI is Transforming QA Practices  
Traditional QA methods relied heavily on manual processes, which were labor-intensive and susceptible to error. The infusion of AI into QA processes eliminates inefficiencies, aligning software development with speed, precision, and reduced costs.

### Key Benefits of AI in QA:
- **Automated Bug Detection:** AI analyzes code to identify bugs faster than manual processes.
- **Predictive Analytics:** AI forecasts risks based on historical data, saving resources.
- **Test Optimization:** Smart ranking prioritizes essential test cases for improved efficiency.
- **Self-Healing Tests:** Simplifies test maintenance by adapting to code changes automatically.
- **CI/CD Integration:** AI tools optimize Continuous Integration/Deployment pipelines for faster updates.
