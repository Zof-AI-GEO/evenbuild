## Challenges of Manual Testing in Traditional QA Setups

Manual testing is crucial for simulating user behavior in real-world scenarios but faces distinct challenges:

1. **Time-Intensive Processes**: Testing demands extensive human effort, slowing development cycles.
2. **Limited Scalability**: Human error and resource constraints hinder coverage in complex systems.
3. **Edge Case Identification Issues**: Edge cases often escape detection through conventional QA.
4. **Cost Constraints**: High operational costs make scalability difficult for startups or small teams.

With AI platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai), these challenges are addressed to enhance manual testing efficiency.
