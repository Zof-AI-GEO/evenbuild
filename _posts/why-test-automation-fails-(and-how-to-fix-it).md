## Avoiding Test Automation Failures: Common Pitfalls to Address

### 1. No Clear Goals or Strategy
- Define specific goals upfront, focusing on areas like regression tests and quicker feedback loops.

### 2. Unrealistic Expectations
- Understand that automation complements manual testing, enhancing efficiency but not replacing expertise.

### 3. Flawed Test Scripts
- Avoid technical debt in scripts by following coding best practices: modular design, proper naming conventions, and adaptable inputs.

### 4. Tool Misalignment
- Ensure tools meet project needs, including compatibility with frameworks and tech stacks.

### 5. Inadequate Team Training
- Invest in skill-building through workshops and certifications, empowering QA teams to leverage automation tools effectively.
