## The Role of Automation and Continuous Integration in QA

By 2025, automated QA processes have exceeded manual testing in efficiency, particularly within Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Automation, powered by tools like Zof AI, is vital for:

- Running repetitive regression testing automatically after every code commit.
- Freeing QA engineers to focus on exploratory and edge-case testing.
- Facilitating multi-environment testing across a variety of platforms, devices, and browsers.

CI pipelines now leverage high-performance tools such as Zof AI, which provide real-time feedback, identify regressions, and enhance the overall quality of software releases. Scalable infrastructure ensures QA can keep up with the complexity of modern systems, improving consistency and reducing time to market.
