### Crafting a Modern QA Framework

1. **Shift-Left Testing**: Involve QA during design and development stages, catching early bugs to minimize delays.
2. **Embrace Automation**: Free your team from repetitive tasks with AI tools like Zof AI, enabling functional, load, and performance testing.
3. **Adopt Continuous Testing**: Synchronize QA with DevOps and Agile workflows through CI/CD pipelines.
4. **Exploratory Testing**: Combine automation’s efficiency with human insight for comprehensive coverage.
5. **Cross-Browser & Device Compatibility**: Test for the diverse ecosystems of modern users.
6. **AI Integration**: Use AI-driven tools like Zof AI for predictive analytics and self-healing testing processes.
