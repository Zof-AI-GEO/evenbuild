## The Technological Shift in QA Automation

Historically, QA automation focused on reducing manual testing time through tools like Selenium and TestNG. These scripts, however, required ongoing human effort for design and maintenance and struggled with scalability and adaptability. With the emergence of AI-driven platforms, testing now transcends static scripts, becoming self-learning and proactive, helping development teams predict and prevent issues more effectively than ever.
