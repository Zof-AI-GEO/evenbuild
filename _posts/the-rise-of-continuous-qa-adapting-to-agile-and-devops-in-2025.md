## What is Continuous QA and Why It Matters

Continuous QA embeds quality checks throughout the software lifecycle, ensuring issues are resolved immediately rather than at later stages. This is vital for success in Agile environments, enabling early bug detection and fostering better collaboration among developers, testers, and operations. 

### Key Benefits of Continuous QA

1. **Shift Left Testing**: Identify bugs earlier in the development lifecycle, saving costly fixes later.
2. **Enhanced Feedback Cycles**: Enable faster feedback and iterative progress.
3. **Collaborative Teams**: Bring QA, development, and operations teams closer together for seamless workflows.
