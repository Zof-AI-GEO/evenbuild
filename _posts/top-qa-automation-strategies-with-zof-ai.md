## Traditional vs AI-Driven QA Tools

### Traditional QA Tools
- Depend on manually created test scripts for predefined scenarios.
- Lack adaptability for complex, dynamic software changes.
- Require constant updates, leading to inefficiencies.

### AI-Driven QA Tools
- Autonomously generate tests and adapt to changes using machine learning (e.g., Zof AI).
- Provide predictive capabilities to uncover bugs before they occur.
- Deliver seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines.

Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) outshine traditional methods by enhancing efficiency, improving scalability, and significantly reducing human intervention.
