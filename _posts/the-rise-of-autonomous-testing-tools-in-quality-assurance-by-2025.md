## What Are Autonomous Testing Tools?

Autonomous testing tools enable QA teams to automate software testing activities with minimal human involvement. Leveraging AI, ML, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), these tools create smarter workflows by:

- Generating automated tests.
- Identifying bugs with precision.
- Suggesting improvements.
- Self-correcting test scripts as applications evolve.

They emulate human testers but with enhanced speed and accuracy, making them indispensable in DevOps and Agile environments. Autonomous tools streamline processes for faster, high-quality software releases.
