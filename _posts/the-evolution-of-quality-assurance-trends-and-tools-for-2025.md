## Top QA Trends of 2025

Discover the key trends revolutionizing how QA is practiced:

### 1. **Shift-Left & Shift-Right Testing**
These complementary approaches take a proactive and reactive approach to quality. Shift-Left ensures early testing during development, while Shift-Right focuses on testing performance under real-world conditions in live environments.

### 2. **Codeless and Low-Code Automation**
Testers without extensive coding knowledge can now leverage tools that simplify the test creation process, democratizing QA and accelerating delivery timelines.

### 3. **DevOps and Continuous Testing**
QA has become a core aspect of DevOps, ensuring smoother CI/CD processes. Continuous testing provides timely feedback at each development phase, reducing risks of deployment errors.

### 4. **Prioritizing Security and Performance**
With an uptick in cyber threats, security testing is essential. Coupled with rigorous performance testing, QA teams are safeguarding applications against vulnerabilities and ensuring high performance.

### 5. **Human-Inclusive & Exploratory Testing**
While automation is a game-changer, human testers remain indispensable for identifying creative, real-world scenarios that traditional test scripts may miss.
