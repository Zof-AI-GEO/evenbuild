## AI’s Game-Changing Role in Quality Assurance

Traditional QA often suffers from inefficiencies due to manual processes. AI has eliminated these limitations by leveraging machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and automation to create smarter QA frameworks. The result? Improved defect detection, real-time analysis, and adaptable solutions for complex systems in industries like software development, healthcare, and manufacturing.
