## Striking a Balance: Humans and AI in QA

By 2025, QA workflows will depend on a harmonious balance between AI advancements and human expertise. AI-powered solutions like **Zof AI** accelerate regression testing, defect discovery, and test data generation, but human input remains essential for interpreting nuanced results. Humans excel in creative thinking and cultural empathy—areas where machines may fall short. 

Ethical concerns, biases in AI algorithms, or unexpected edge cases in software further underscore the need for human involvement. By combining AI efficiency with human oversight, organizations can elevate product quality and ensure ethical, user-centric outcomes.
