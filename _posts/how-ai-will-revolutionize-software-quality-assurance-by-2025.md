## The Current Landscape: Traditional QA vs. AI-Driven QA

Traditional QA relied heavily on human testers and rule-based automation tools with limitations like resource intensiveness and prone-to-errors scripting. With AI, that paradigm is shifting dramatically. Cutting-edge algorithms powered by machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) are automating:

- Dynamic test case generation.
- Predictive fault detection.
- Advanced exploratory testing automation.

AI tools are streamlining workflows, reducing manual maintenance, and eliminating inefficiencies.
