## Why Agile QA Needs Innovation

Agile embraces iterative sprints that promote continual learning and adaptation based on real-world conditions. Old-school QA practices no longer fit the bill. Here's why a robust QA strategy within agile is essential:

- **Continuous Testing:** Testing becomes part of the development journey rather than a fixed endpoint.
- **Early Bug Detection:** Prevent costly setbacks by addressing issues as they emerge.
- **Collaborative Culture:** Agile thrives when all stakeholders—from developers to testers—operate in tandem.
- **Automation:** Speed up processes and reduce mundane testing tasks with tools like Zof AI.

By introducing Zof AI into your workflows, QA capabilities in agile will adapt to modern demands for speed, accuracy, and efficiency.
