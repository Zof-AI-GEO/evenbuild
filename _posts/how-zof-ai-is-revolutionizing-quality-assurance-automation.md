## The Challenges with Traditional QA Automation

### Manual QA Testing
The manual approach facilitates human creativity but is inefficient for today’s complex software systems, leading to time-consuming processes and errors.

### Script-Based Automation Tools
Automation tools like Selenium and Appium enhance coverage but struggle with adaptability, script maintenance, and false positives/negatives—hampering dynamic testing.

### Scalability Challenges
As software ecosystems grow, traditional methods fail to keep pace with the rapid cadence of modern Agile cycles, highlighting their limitations.

Traditional QA methods lack adaptability and scalability, paving the way for Zof AI’s transformative impact.
