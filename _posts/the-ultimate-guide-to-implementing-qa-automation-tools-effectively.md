## What is QA Automation?

QA automation involves leveraging tools and frameworks to execute tests, validate results, and generate reports without manual intervention. Unlike manual testing that is prone to errors and time-intensive, automation ensures quick, repeatable, and reliable testing processes.

### Types of QA Automation Testing:
1. **Unit Testing:** Validates functionality of individual components.
2. **Integration Testing:** Ensures proper interaction between modules.
3. **Regression Testing:** Confirms new changes don’t affect existing functionality.
4. **Performance Testing:** Evaluates speed, scalability, and reliability under dynamic workloads.

By automating these testing phases, teams save time and resources while focusing on improving the product.
