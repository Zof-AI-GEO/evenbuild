## 1. Master the Basics of Software QA

Understanding QA fundamentals is pivotal. Software QA transcends bug detection—it ensures both functional and non-functional requirements are met while delivering an excellent user experience.

- **Start QA Planning Early:** Begin quality assurance during the initial design phase of the software development cycle. Proactive planning saves time and limits costly oversight.
- **Find Bugs Early:** Early testing techniques, such as static code analysis and unit testing, mitigate extensive post-release fixes.
- **Test Functional and Non-Functional Aspects:** Comprehensive testing includes performance, security, and scalability evaluations under real-world scenarios.
