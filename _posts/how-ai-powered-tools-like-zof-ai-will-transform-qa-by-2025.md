## How AI is Redefining Quality Assurance

AI adoption in software testing is skyrocketing as organizations address common testing challenges, including scalability, error detection, and efficiency. Traditional testing models, which rely on manual processes or automation tools like Selenium, are being outpaced by AI systems that excel at analyzing large data sets, predicting test outcomes, and learning from system behaviors without constant human intervention.

For example, AI frameworks utilize machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision to highlight vulnerabilities, catch complex bugs, and ensure resilient performance. Platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) are revolutionizing QA by autonomously building test cases, analyzing code patterns, and identifying potential issues long before release.
