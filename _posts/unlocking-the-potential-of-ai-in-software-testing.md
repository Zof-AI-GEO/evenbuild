## Challenges in Traditional Testing Methods

Traditional testing approaches face critical limitations in meeting modern development needs.

### 1. **Limited Scalability**
Static manual testing processes hinder scalability as applications evolve rapidly in continuous development cycles. Adaptive testing is essential to address edge cases robustly.

### 2. **Time and Cost Intensive**
Manual testing demands considerable human effort and extended durations, inflating costs. Even automated frameworks require regular updates to test scripts, increasing inefficiencies.

### 3. **Human Errors**
Repetitive tasks elevate human error risks, leaving undetected vulnerabilities that can lead to costly bugs in production setups.

### 4. **Lack of Predictive Insights**
Traditional methods focus solely on identifying existing flaws. Predictive analytics, which identifies issues before they arise, is often missing.

AI is addressing these inefficiencies, filling critical gaps in traditional testing frameworks.
