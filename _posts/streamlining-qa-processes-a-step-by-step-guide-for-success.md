## Common QA Workflow Pain Points

### 1. **Manual Testing Challenges**
Labor-intensive and time-consuming manual testing fails to scale with growing software complexities, delaying deployments.

### 2. **Limited Team Collaboration**
Cross-functional communication gaps between QA teams and stakeholders lead to inefficiency and misaligned priorities.

### 3. **Automation Deficiencies**
Traditional workflows neglect smart automation, slowing progress and increasing manual errors.

### 4. **Partial Test Coverage**
Missed vulnerabilities from inadequate coverage increase risks for end-users and harm product quality.

### 5. **Difficulty Aligning QA with Agile/DevOps**
Traditional workflows fail to adapt to iterative, fast-paced methodologies like Agile, undermining efficiency and delays.

Address these pain points by adopting innovative AI-powered solutions designed to future-proof your QA pipelines.
