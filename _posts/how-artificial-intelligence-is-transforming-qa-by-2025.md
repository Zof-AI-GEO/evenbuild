## The Role of AI in Modern QA Processes

Conventional QA has relied largely on manual test cases, repetitive regression testing, and often error-prone human processes. While automation tools like Selenium or Appium have streamlined certain workflows, they fall short of leveraging AI’s predictive and adaptive technologies.

Here’s how AI is currently enhancing QA:

1. **Automated Test Generation**: AI tools analyze application histories and user behavior to autonomously generate relevant test cases tailored to specific requirements.
2. **Advanced Defect Prediction**: By utilizing historical defect data and change logs, AI algorithms can identify high-risk areas before code deployment.
3. **Real-Time Parallel Testing**: AI enables continuous testing across multiple devices simultaneously, speeding up feedback cycles.
4. **Self-Healing Test Scripts**: AI dynamically adapts test cases in response to changes within the codebase or application environment.

Although AI’s impact is significant, we’re just scratching the surface. By 2025, AI will transition into full orchestration, setting new benchmarks for efficiency and accuracy.
