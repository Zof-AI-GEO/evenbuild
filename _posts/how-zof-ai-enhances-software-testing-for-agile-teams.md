## Addressing QA Bottlenecks in Agile Teams

Agile teams focus on iterative work within frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban. QA processes often lag due to:

### 1. **Short Testing Cycles**  
Tight sprint schedules leave limited time for comprehensive manual testing, increasing the risk of undetected bugs.

### 2. **Continuous Integration Challenges**  
Manual regression testing becomes infeasible in rapidly evolving CI/CD environments.

### 3. **Scalability Problems**  
As project complexity grows, traditional QA struggles to scale, causing bottlenecks in workflows.

### 4. **Resource Constraints**  
Limited budgets and staffing hinder efficient QA, forcing Agile teams to search for automation solutions.

### 5. **Balancing Quality and Speed**  
Reconciling fast-paced delivery with rigorous quality assurance often poses a significant challenge.
