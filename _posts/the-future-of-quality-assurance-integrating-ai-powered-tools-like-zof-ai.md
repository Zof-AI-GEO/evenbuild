## 1. Evolution of QA in Software Development: From Manual to AI

To appreciate the role of AI in modern QA, we must examine the field’s progression:

- **Manual Testing Era:** Initially, QA testing relied entirely on human efforts to identify bugs and errors. While comprehensive, this method was tedious, prone to mistakes, and inconsistent.

- **Emergence of Automated Testing:** Automation revolutionized QA by eliminating repetitive tasks, offering consistent test execution, and improving test coverage, though script-building and maintenance required significant resources.

- **Present Day:** Today’s software demands agile methodologies, faster delivery, and more robust testing processes. AI tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) provide proactive, intelligent solutions that predict issues and reduce manual workload, overcoming modern QA challenges.
