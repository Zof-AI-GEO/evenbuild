## Why QA Methodologies Are Transforming in the Digital Age

In recent years, Agile and DevOps methodologies have revolutionized QA, shifting from late-stage testing to early, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems. Modern QA has expanded to address performance, security, and scalability for applications catering to global audiences.

Technologies like AI and machine learning are transforming testing workflows by automating processes, predicting defects, and optimizing regression testing, making QA faster and more cost-efficient. Additionally, shift-left testing integrates quality assurance early in the design phase, reducing errors and fostering better products.
