## The Evolution of QA: Foundation for 2025

In the last decade, QA transitioned from manual testing to an automated and strategic process, shaping product quality at scale. Recent changes include:

- **Shift-left testing**: Detecting issues earlier in the development cycle reduces time and costs.
- **Microservices and containerization**: Testing for distributed systems requires real-time validation.
- **Test automation**: Tools like Selenium and Appium enhanced speed and efficiency.
- **DevOps integration**: Continuous testing supports fast and reliable software delivery.

Built on these advancements, QA in 2025 will embrace smarter technologies that optimize efficiency and precision.
