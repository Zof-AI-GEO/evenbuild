## What is Continuous Testing and Why Does It Matter?

### Continuous Testing — The Future of QA
Continuous Testing refers to the practice of running automated tests throughout every stage of the software development pipeline. Unlike traditional QA, which conducts testing at specific checkpoints, Continuous Testing integrates QA into every phase of the lifecycle, enabling teams to identify errors and inefficiencies in real-time.

In the fast-paced world of 2025, software organizations aim for swift releases without sacrificing quality. Continuous Testing empowers teams to address potential issues proactively, ensuring stability, performance, and user satisfaction.
