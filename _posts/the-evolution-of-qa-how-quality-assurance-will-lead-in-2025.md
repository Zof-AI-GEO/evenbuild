## Automation and QA Trends to Watch in 2025

With software complexity advancing, QA automation tools are evolving to improve scalability, user experience, and cross-platform compatibility. These trends include:

### 1. **Scriptless Automation**
   Opening accessibility to QA teams of all technical levels, scriptless platforms will revolutionize testing workflows, enabling manual testers and product managers to directly influence QA outcomes.

### 2. **Hyperautomation**
   By integrating AI and Robotic Process Automation (RPA), hyperautomation will eliminate redundancies and streamline processes across hybrid systems, scaling QA operations efficiently.

### 3. **Shift-Left and Shift-Right Strategies**
   Early-stage testing (shift-left) will pinpoint issues before they arise, while shift-right methods ensure continuous monitoring, optimizing live environments.

### 4. **Integration with DevOps**
   QA will get tightly embedded into DevOps practices—using feedback automation and real-time testing to enhance reliability and speed-to-market.
