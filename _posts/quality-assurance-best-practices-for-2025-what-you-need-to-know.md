## **1. Transformative QA Methodologies for 2025**

### **Agile and DevOps QA**
Streamlined collaboration and iterative testing remain at the forefront of successful development workflows. Incorporate shift-left testing, automation-first strategies, and cross-team collaboration into your QA processes to accelerate delivery.

### **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
Align QA with business objectives using plain language scenarios to ensure software meets user expectations.

### **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
Proactively reduce bugs by writing test cases before coding begins.
