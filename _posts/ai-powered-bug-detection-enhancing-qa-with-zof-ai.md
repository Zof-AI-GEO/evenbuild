## Outdated Bug Detection Methods Are Holding You Back

Traditional QA heavily relies on meticulous, manual code reviews paired with standard debugging tools. While these methods have served software developers for decades, they come with significant drawbacks.

### Challenges of Traditional QA:
1. **Time Inefficiency**: Traditional methods require exhaustive effort and often delay project timelines.
2. **Human Oversight**: Mistakes or missed bugs are unavoidable during manual testing.
3. **Scaling Issues**: Expanding software complexity overwhelms conventional testing practices.
4. **Delayed Problem Discovery**: Bugs detected late in the process can cause unnecessary project reworks and higher costs.

Modern software development demands agility and precision, urging teams to search for faster, more reliable QA solutions—a challenge AI is set to solve.
