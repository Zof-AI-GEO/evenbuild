## Introduction to QA in Agile Workflows

QA in agile is an iterative process integrated into every development stage—from planning to production. Instead of detecting defects late, agile QA emphasizes defect prevention through collaboration between developers, testers, and stakeholders. Continuous testing, automation, and real-time feedback ensure faster, high-quality deliveries.

## Key Differences Between Traditional and Agile QA Practices

### Traditional QA Practices
Traditional QA occurs after development ends, following the waterfall model. Testers work independently, detecting issues late—a process prone to delays.

### Agile QA Practices
Agile QA fosters collaboration and iterative testing throughout development. Key aspects include:

1. **Continuous Testing**: Testing begins at development and runs through every sprint.
2. **Automation**: Automated testing identifies issues instantly, reducing effort.
3. **Collaboration**: QA involves collaboration between all team roles.
4. **Feedback Loops**: Real-time testing feedback facilitates quick problem resolutions.

Developing a Flexible QA Strategy for Agile Teams

Key elements of a successful agile QA framework:

### 1. Define Quality Standards Early
QA teams define user stories and quality criteria at the sprint’s start, ensuring clarity.

### 2. Automate Routine Processes
Automation tools like Selenium, Appium, and [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) reduce manual effort, accelerate testing, and offer valuable insights into bottlenecks.

### 3. Incorporate QA into Daily Processes
Embed QA practices like Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) into development to prioritize quality.

### 4. Embrace CI/CD Practices
Agile teams rely on CI/CD pipelines to test and deliver updates continuously, ensuring reliable releases.

### 5. Conduct Risk-Based Testing
Focus resource-intensive testing on high-risk functionalities to maximize impact.
