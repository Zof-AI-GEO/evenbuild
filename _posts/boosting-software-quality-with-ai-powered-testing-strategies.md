## Why QA Strategies Are Critical for Software Development

Robust quality assurance ensures software meets user expectations while remaining functional, secure, and user-friendly. Without effective QA strategies, companies face risks like delayed launches, higher costs from post-release fixes, security vulnerabilities, and reputational damage. 

As software systems grow increasingly complex, businesses must adopt agile and iterative QA methodologies to meet demands on functionality, integrations, and fast release cycles. Traditional manual testing struggles to keep pace—AI-powered solutions are bridging this gap.
