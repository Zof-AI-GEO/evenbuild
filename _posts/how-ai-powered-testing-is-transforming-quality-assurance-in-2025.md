## How AI Eliminates Testing Bottlenecks

Traditional QA processes often result in delays due to manual interventions and unclear test outcomes. AI addresses these pain points by using advanced machine learning models to:

- Analyze vast datasets to identify risks and failures.
- Predict user behavior and prevent future crashes.
- Automate repetitive tasks, allowing QA teams to shift focus to strategic roles.

For example, [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) performs predictive simulations to anticipate and mitigate potential errors, significantly speeding up regression and exploratory testing phases.
