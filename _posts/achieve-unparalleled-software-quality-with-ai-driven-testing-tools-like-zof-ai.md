## Why Traditional Testing Methods No Longer Suffice

### 1. **Productivity Bottlenecks**
High human effort and the extensive time required for manual testing result in slow software release cycles, increasing operational costs.

### 2. **Limited Test Coverage**
Complex applications demand comprehensive test coverage, which traditional approaches struggle to achieve, especially for edge cases.

### 3. **Error-prone Execution**
Human errors and misinterpretations during repetitive tests can lead to missed bugs and quality issues.

### 4. **Regression Testing Struggles**
Frequent updates and patch releases require quick, effective regression testing that traditional QA methods can't efficiently execute.

### 5. **Lagging Behind Modern Architectures**
Microservices, APIs, and cloud-native infrastructures need more dynamic testing approaches than legacy methods can offer.
