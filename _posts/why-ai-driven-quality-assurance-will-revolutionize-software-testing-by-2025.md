## Traditional vs. AI-Driven QA: A Paradigm Shift

Traditional QA relied on manual testing and automation tools, but these approaches lack scalability and adaptability. Let’s compare it to cutting-edge AI-driven QA:

### The Challenges of Traditional QA
1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Time-intensive and error-prone.
   - Struggles to adapt to Agile and DevOps cycles.
2. **Traditional Automation**:
   - Complex and resource-heavy to maintain.
   - Limited adaptability for dynamic systems.

### The Advantages of AI-Driven QA
AI-driven QA employs machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and algorithms to automate and optimize testing. Tools like Zof AI deliver self-healing scripts, predictive defect analysis, and unparalleled test scalability. Key advantages include:
- Adapting to application changes.
- Prioritizing test cases via AI algorithms.
- Reducing manual intervention and boosting QA efficiency.
