## Manual Testing vs Automated Testing: Key Highlights

### Manual Testing Overview
Manual testing relies on human expertise to evaluate software functionality without automation tools. It excels in identifying usability flaws, performing exploratory testing, and adapting to dynamic requirements.

### Automated Testing Overview
Automated testing leverages tools like Selenium, Appium, and AI-powered platforms such as [Zof AI](https://zof.ai?src=evenbuild.vercel.app) to execute tests efficiently and consistently in scalable CI/CD pipelines. Perfect for regression, performance, and repetitive testing tasks.
