## The Bottlenecks in Traditional QA Testing

Despite its importance, QA testing often hits roadblocks that reduce efficiency and effectiveness. Manual processes demand significant time and expertise, while even automated scripting requires human oversight that can introduce errors and limit scalability. Key limitations in current QA systems include:

1. **Time-Consuming Processes:** Large applications require exhaustive manual testing, prolonging product launches.
2. **Human Error:** Mistakes in script generation or bug detection are common.
3. **Limited Scalability:** Existing testing frameworks struggle with scaling for complex architectures.
4. **High Operational Costs:** QA testing budgets can soar due to reliance on outdated tools and labor-intensive methodologies.
5. **Incomplete Coverage:** Full-spectrum testing remains challenging, leaving gaps that compromise software reliability.

The demand for smarter, scalable solutions led to the rise of AI-powered platforms like Zof AI.
