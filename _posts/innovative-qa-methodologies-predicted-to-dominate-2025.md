## The Evolution from Traditional Testing to Modern QA Approaches

Historically, QA was a siloed process conducted at the end of development cycles. Testing was reactive, focusing mainly on identifying bugs before product release. Today, the rise of agile and DevOps methodologies demands proactive and integrated QA approaches.

### Key Shifts in QA Methodologies:
- **Defect Prevention Over Detection:** Modern QA starts early, addressing process improvements during design and coding phases to reduce defects.
- **Automation Dominance:** Automated testing ensures scalability and speed, complementing—not replacing—manual testing.
- **Customer-Centric Focus:** Quality now extends beyond functionality to include usability and user satisfaction.

Technological innovations like **Zof AI** are propelling these shifts with systems designed to foster collaboration, ensure adaptability, and establish quality benchmarks throughout agile workflows.
